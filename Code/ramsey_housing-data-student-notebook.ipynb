    "\n",
    "## Background and Context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical Housing Discrimination\n",
    "Racial covenants were legal clauses in property deeds that prohibited sale or occupancy by non-white people. These discriminatory practices, along with redlining and other systematic forms of housing discrimination, shaped the demographic and economic patterns we see in our cities today. While racial covenants were made illegal by the Fair Housing Act of 1968, their effects continue to influence modern housing patterns, property values, and wealth distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mapping Prejudice Project at the University of Minnesota has documented over 30,000 racial covenants in ramsey County. These covenants, implemented between 1910 and 1955, created lasting patterns of segregation and economic disparity that persist in modern data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modern Mortgage Lending\n",
    "Today, most mortgage lending decisions involve algorithmic systems that assess credit risk and determine loan approval. While these systems don't explicitly consider race, they may perpetuate historical biases through:\n",
    "- Property valuations influenced by historical segregation\n",
    "- Neighborhood characteristics shaped by past discrimination\n",
    "- Economic factors that reflect generational wealth disparities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project examines the relationship between historical housing discrimination and modern lending patterns, focusing on two distinct types of bias:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Bias**: How historical discrimination is embedded in modern data\n",
    "   - Property values in areas with/without historical covenants\n",
    "   - Neighborhood demographic and economic characteristics\n",
    "   - Patterns of generational wealth and investment\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Algorithmic Bias**: How modern lending systems might perpetuate discrimination\n",
    "   - Mortgage approval rates and terms\n",
    "   - Risk assessment criteria\n",
    "   - The use of potentially biased proxy variables\n",
    "\n",
