[3/13/2025 6:06 PM] Chance
But yeah, that's that's kind of where like I'm.


[3/13/2025 6:06 PM] Chance
Thank you.


[3/13/2025 6:06 PM] Chance
them like, there's...


[3/13/2025 6:06 PM] Chance
new assistant way.


[3/13/2025 6:06 PM] Autumn
And I'm curious, too, like, um, there's G, I'll see, G-O, okay, and me.


[3/13/2025 6:06 PM] Autumn
Um.


[3/13/2025 6:06 PM] Autumn
and a pin county racial covenants data that


[3/13/2025 6:06 PM] Autumn
We were provided or


[3/13/2025 6:06 PM] Chance
the the table one.


[3/13/2025 6:06 PM] Autumn
one on the left side, the table one, yes.


[3/13/2025 6:06 PM] Autumn
So that in column Z has or I'm sorry you is distance and then


[3/13/2025 6:06 PM] Autumn
the henna pin


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
County Covenants table that's on GitHub.


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
That's formatted like the Ramsey County one.


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
has in common.


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
Z what is it geo CD distance? I'm wondering if that's the same thing and if that


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
as any rebel dance.


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Chance
Let me pull up the...


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Chance
Data dictionary.


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
Okay, you know, I was...


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Chance
Because that was a...


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
Nope.


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Chance
So I'll drop that link in the...


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Autumn
I'm finished, nerd.


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Chance
if you go to that link.


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Ashlyn
Oh!


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Chance
So distance refers to...


[3/13/2025 6:07 PM] Chance
Distance of the current address point
 from the closest parcel polygonal boundary.
 A value of zero indicates the current address point
 falls within the parcel boundary.
 Unit is in meters.


[3/13/2025 6:08 PM] Ashlyn
are you'll have an issue with merging them?


[3/13/2025 6:08 PM] Chance
Because yeah, like, there's no...


[3/13/2025 6:08 PM] Autumn
Like action why was creepy? A-dead.


[3/13/2025 6:08 PM] Chance
And I, yes, could just cry.


[3/13/2025 6:08 PM] Ashlyn
to help them GPT.


[3/13/2025 6:08 PM] Chance
What did you hurt?


[3/13/2025 6:08 PM] Ashlyn
You have to update.


[3/13/2025 6:08 PM] Ashlyn
If you


[3/13/2025 6:08 PM] Chance
Or did you?


[3/13/2025 6:08 PM] Ashlyn
Let me send the link to my GitHub, I put my file on there.


[3/13/2025 6:08 PM] Autumn
I just want to show.


[3/13/2025 6:08 PM] Chance
Yeah, because like I, like I said, I sent both file like all the files I had through chat GPT just like a like hey can you like


[3/13/2025 6:08 PM] Chance
like infer any similarities in this information.


[3/13/2025 6:08 PM] Ashlyn
What is it? So...


[3/13/2025 6:09 PM] Ashlyn
PRF.


[3/13/2025 6:09 PM] Chance
the wait which one?


[3/13/2025 6:09 PM] Ashlyn
But the RS is have to be XGB.


[3/13/2025 6:09 PM] Ashlyn
I don't know what the heck that is!


[3/13/2025 6:09 PM] Ashlyn
they have to match. When we talk


[3/13/2025 6:09 PM] Ashlyn
to find.


[3/13/2025 6:09 PM] Ashlyn
It wouldn't work, so I was...


[3/13/2025 6:09 PM] Ashlyn
for each of them in order for me to merge them.


[3/13/2025 6:09 PM] Ashlyn
different. So I had to change it for her.


[3/13/2025 6:09 PM] Chance
But I don't think it's an issue as...


[3/13/2025 6:09 PM] Chance
the...


[3/13/2025 6:09 PM] Chance
I don't uh, hold on, uh, control the, hold each other, bye.


[3/13/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
Um.


[3/13/2025 6:10 PM] Kirstin
and finally oh my gosh.


[3/13/2025 6:10 PM] Kirstin
Hey, now I see you.


[3/13/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
But yeah, because it's like...


[3/13/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
the issue there.


[3/13/2025 6:10 PM] Kirstin
And it wouldn't take by class for it.


[3/13/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
The issue that I encountered with the Ramsey County data is that there isn't


[3/13/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
a latitude and longitude.


[3/13/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
the time so.


[3/13/2025 6:10 PM] Ashlyn
I don't even got that far.


[3/13/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
so it's like.


[3/13/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
So like the way the student notebook is like laid out.


[3/13/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
It's meant for that table CSV thing that you sent, Ashlin.


[3/13/2025 6:10 PM] Chance
And then like the next section is like


[3/13/2025 6:11 PM] Chance
converting the x and y variables from that data set into


[3/13/2025 6:11 PM] Chance
Latitude and longitude, errrr.


[3/13/2025 6:11 PM] Chance
into census data tracks.


[3/13/2025 6:11 PM] Chance
It's like if we don't, if we don't have the


[3/13/2025 6:11 PM] Kirstin
Kirstin disconnected


[3/13/2025 6:11 PM] Chance
like either of those, oh, let me see.


[3/13/2025 6:11 PM] Chance
I don't think we have that information, the...


[3/13/2025 6:11 PM] Autumn
I'm not- I didn't see it.
 Um, and that's why I'm almost want to heat- you know, that's what's in the student notebook is X and Y, but I'm-


[3/13/2025 6:11 PM] Chance
What does it look like?


[3/13/2025 6:11 PM] Autumn
I'm not wondering if it's necessary, I mean it's like this is where it gets tricky because you have like the track and you have


[3/13/2025 6:11 PM] Autumn
Latitude and longitude.


[3/13/2025 6:11 PM] Autumn
if


[3/13/2025 6:11 PM] Chance
But it's like there may be one thing if it's like, oh, like the census tract information is in the


[3/13/2025 6:11 PM] Chance
Um.


[3/13/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
The Ramsey.


[3/13/2025 6:12 PM] Chance
is in the like the Ramsey County data set.


[3/13/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
Good morning.


[3/13/2025 6:12 PM] Ashlyn
to of mine.


[3/13/2025 6:12 PM] Ashlyn
I looked up the senses.


[3/13/2025 6:12 PM] Ashlyn
G and it gave me that.


[3/13/2025 6:12 PM] Ashlyn
and let me change the covenant one to the same.
 So in section three, I was able to merge
 this and the covenant.


[3/13/2025 6:12 PM] Chance
Can you share your screen?


[3/13/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
I was the analysis, we'll bet.


[3/13/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
Okay, thank you for sharing that because I was thinking what he gave us was like henna pin and how he was


[3/13/2025 6:12 PM] Autumn
it emerge. So I really didn't go through the process of emerging anything with hand-up in.
 Bye!


[3/13/2025 6:12 PM] Chance
That's how I interpreted it, was that like, because it's like they wouldn't be the same
 census tract, and to my understanding.


[3/13/2025 6:13 PM] Chance
So yeah, you've got...


[3/13/2025 6:13 PM] Autumn
I'm...


[3/13/2025 6:13 PM] Chance
Here you've got the...


[3/13/2025 6:13 PM] Ashlyn
That's the henna pin.


[3/13/2025 6:13 PM] Ashlyn
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:13 PM] Ashlyn
the X and Y.


[3/13/2025 6:13 PM] Ashlyn
I checked the spring.


[3/13/2025 6:13 PM] Chance
Yeah, that's you.


[3/13/2025 6:13 PM] Ashlyn
whatever this CRS is.


[3/13/2025 6:13 PM] Ashlyn
We're both in match pretty much the sensitive.


[3/13/2025 6:13 PM] Ashlyn
and the covenant.
 Thank you.


[3/13/2025 6:13 PM] Ashlyn
to merge.


[3/13/2025 6:13 PM] Chance
So yeah, that's.


[3/13/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
That's just for the Hennepin County data.


[3/13/2025 6:14 PM] Autumn
Yeah, and that that makes me.


[3/13/2025 6:14 PM] Autumn
Oh


[3/13/2025 6:14 PM] Autumn
I'm sorry because, um, yeah, so you've got...


[3/13/2025 6:14 PM] Autumn
the x and the y.


[3/13/2025 6:14 PM] Autumn
because that data was formatted. Right? You use the data, it's like straight from
 the the web's the mapping prejudice or the University of Minnesota website
 like the original data.


[3/13/2025 6:14 PM] Ashlyn
I was just trying to fuck it up.


[3/13/2025 6:14 PM] Chance
Yeah, because like I'm.


[3/13/2025 6:14 PM] Autumn
Gotcha. Yeah, that's why it's perfect.


[3/13/2025 6:14 PM] Ashlyn
was working for me.


[3/13/2025 6:14 PM] Autumn
Yeah, that's, yeah, that's what I started with. That's why when I chimed in yesterday,
 she was like, I have that data. I'm like, what is your problem? Maybe I need to stop.


[3/13/2025 6:14 PM] Autumn
talking because I obviously am laugh.


[3/13/2025 6:15 PM] Autumn
I'm like, okay, I'm doing something different.


[3/13/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
Yeah, because it's like I was able to run the full workbook or the whole the full student notebook.


[3/13/2025 6:15 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
or.


[3/13/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
for the...


[3/13/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
Hennepin County, Dato, because basically the, the student
 of book is how he created or how he got the,


[3/13/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
mortgage covenant data for us.


[3/13/2025 6:15 PM] Autumn
So that's...


[3/13/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
because then like he provided that and then like,
 that's whenever he said like, okay, now expand it to...


[3/13/2025 6:15 PM] Autumn
ramsy and then ramsy with a whole different beast.


[3/13/2025 6:15 PM] Autumn
Like you said, though.


[3/13/2025 6:15 PM] Chance
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:15 PM] Autumn
shape so it's um again i'm trying to look at it just by titles and see what


[3/13/2025 6:15 PM] Autumn
the most relevant.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
um


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
all the coordinates are on there and that deals with the tracks but


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
Let me.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
I'm wondering if there's a way we could just.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
Mm.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
Use something else and merge it.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
on a different um.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
variable.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
And just use like the senses trout.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
versus trying to emerge the census tracts.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
or change them to latitude and longitude, or I can't remember what he said in there. Am I making any sense? And if not, maybe we just go about this a whole different route.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
I'm not sure.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
Well, and that's, let's like wait.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
I don't believe it.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
like I'm surprised that he hasn't like responded because


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Autumn
We'll talk.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
here. Hold on, I'm making a, I'm,


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
Ramsay.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
I'm going to...


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Chance
Okay, it's done.


[3/13/2025 6:16 PM] Kirstin
Do you email him or something?


[3/13/2025 6:17 PM] Kirstin
in the discussion.


[3/13/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
So I did it because right whenever I was getting ready to I saw the Isaiah had posted about it. So I was like, oh, like


[3/13/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
I was like, okay, yeah, like, we're not the only group
 that's having the, that's encountering.


[3/13/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
Um.


[3/13/2025 6:17 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, here's, let's see, last post yesterday.


[3/13/2025 6:17 PM] Kirstin
I'm going to get the new data set up for Ramsey County. It doesn't even know.


[3/13/2025 6:17 PM] Kirstin
where the covenants table comes from.


[3/13/2025 6:17 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, the only comments are from you and IZ.


[3/13/2025 6:17 PM] Kirstin
love that.


[3/13/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
But like, I had responded to...


[3/13/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
to somebody's message on.


[3/13/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
Thursday of last week, like right after class.


[3/13/2025 6:17 PM] Chance
Yeah, and then I was like, hey.


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Autumn
Abby had posted something and I remember when he told her that this was just like start with the original data set or whatever it


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Autumn
You may have what you really need.


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Chance
Hold on, um...


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Chance
uh


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Chance
I'm like making a


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Chance
copy of the student workbook that


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Chance
is...


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Chance
that just mimics everything that is in the


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Chance
Staying.


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Chance
like that's already in there.


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Autumn
mm-hmm.


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Chance
I'm sorry.
 I'm not recording.


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, and he had responded to that one from Abby just saying,
 if you look at the code, it talks more about where the data came from.


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Chance
Well, enough for fingers.


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Kirstin
and how it was created, like, okay.


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Chance
Well, in like I get that.


[3/13/2025 6:18 PM] Autumn
Thank you.


[3/13/2025 6:19 PM] Chance
But also, like, whenever I was trying to create it, like, I couldn't, I did not know that that table fight, like, I could not find that table CS3 to save my life.


[3/13/2025 6:19 PM] Chance
And that's why whenever I was looking at their GitHub,
 I found this other data set that like, why isn't this working?


[3/13/2025 6:19 PM] Autumn
Yeah. Well, and it's interesting because, you know, on the mapping prejudice, I mean, it clearly has henna pens. Someone took that.


[3/13/2025 6:19 PM] Autumn
and did more extensive work because when you click on the other counties, it takes you to the GitHub site.


[3/13/2025 6:19 PM] Autumn
So it's...


[3/13/2025 6:19 PM] Autumn
And I just can't name it. Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:19 PM] Chance
Yeah, so it's like that's where I'm like really confused because I'm like


[3/13/2025 6:19 PM] Chance
All right, let's...


[3/13/2025 6:19 PM] Ashlyn
which group member you want to be.


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
So yeah, this...


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
Here, let me show my screen.


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
you could you can keep your it yeah it doesn't


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
This quarter doesn't.


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
So.


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
Not like, not like us.


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
whatever it's called zoom.
 Um, so this is


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
So this is the...


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Kirstin
It's so shiny.


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
Oh, um.


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
and hold on I can also change the color that way you can...


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
a little bit.


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
Let's go.


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
There we go.


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
um...
 Troll Shirt... uh... view...


[3/13/2025 6:20 PM] Chance
is their control equals, that is the


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
So.


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
This is the


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
the notebook as it.


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Autumn
given to us. Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
as it was like, this is the one that was on dtl. And then I adapted it to where it pulls from


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
the like the files that are in GitHub.


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Autumn
Hmm.


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
Um.


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
So.


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
Yeah, there's Hennepin Counties.


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
Koo-da!


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
that pulls.


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
the census tracks.


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Kirstin
All right.


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
Oh, save.


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
Tuh, no.


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
and then data available, pulls that in a Soto file.


[3/13/2025 6:21 PM] Chance
Pulls that table.


[3/13/2025 6:22 PM] Chance
And then...


[3/13/2025 6:22 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:22 PM] Chance
It's just those that are causing the issue, but then


[3/13/2025 6:22 PM] Autumn
And you, we don't need, because that was so...


[3/13/2025 6:22 PM] Autumn
when I looked at the data dictionary, it says that was like
 created by the software.


[3/13/2025 6:22 PM] Autumn
they used or something. So it's interesting that that column is in there because it doesn't relate


[3/13/2025 6:22 PM] Chance
the FID.


[3/13/2025 6:22 PM] Autumn
Yeah!


[3/13/2025 6:22 PM] Chance
well i think it's probably just like


[3/13/2025 6:22 PM] Chance
It's probably like a primary key like it's just what they use.


[3/13/2025 6:22 PM] Chance
to like.


[3/13/2025 6:22 PM] Chance
It's easier to assign each row or each entry a number than to


[3/13/2025 6:22 PM] Chance
there's probably like what i would imagine is there's another table that has


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Chance
like all of the address information or like parts of the relevant information,
 and then like it has this as a


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Chance
as a column somewhere.


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
Got to chill.


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
Yeah, I was just thinking that's not relevant to like the other data, I think he's not going to match any of the other.


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Chance
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Chance
within.


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
Neables that work for at least my knowledge because they weren't created in the same way.


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Chance
So then after merging, this is our...


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Chance
completed data set.


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
I want this T-Mine to...


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
to go back since you're sharing your sc... I mean, just scroll back. I'm looking at the columns.


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
And I'm sorry where you were in that code block or in the output, I guess at the bottom, scroll back to the left.
 Yeah, thank you.


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
This is so cool.


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Chance
Yeah, here's all of the columns as well.


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
Oh, thank you, duh.


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
Um.


[3/13/2025 6:23 PM] Autumn
see it's got the sense number is x and y?


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Autumn
even in there?


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Chance
Well, so this, this is, this is how.


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Chance
Via...


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Chance
Mortgage Covenant data was created.


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Chance
Yes.


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Autumn
right and it that was because that was the merge correct i'm just figuring i'm wondering


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Autumn
how we could get.


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Autumn
similar


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Autumn
Results.


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Autumn
Just.


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Chance
So let me go back to this.


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Autumn
but I'm going to just play, you know.


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Chance
So this is the one that I made for Ramsay County.


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Chance
Bye.


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Chance
Um, no, chitch-chitch.


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Chance
WorkageData.shape.com.


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Kirstin
The pants.


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Chance
So.


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Kirstin
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:24 PM] Chance
or get stated.


[3/13/2025 6:25 PM] Chance
All you counts.


[3/13/2025 6:25 PM] Chance
What the, what's the?


[3/13/2025 6:25 PM] Chance
and subtract.


[3/13/2025 6:25 PM] Chance
What are


[3/13/2025 6:25 PM] Autumn
Yeah, I know that's, you know, in the coast recently, um, it was stated like this where it gets tricky because there was latitude and longitude and one had census tract, but


[3/13/2025 6:25 PM] Autumn
Then do we even do we even need the X and Y if we've got census tract and we're looking at it by triax and those are


[3/13/2025 6:25 PM] Autumn
The essentially the same pieces of data, um...


[3/13/2025 6:25 PM] Chance
I guess so, yeah, but


[3/13/2025 6:25 PM] Chance
Mr. Tramall.


[3/13/2025 6:25 PM] Autumn
I would be eating what I mean like can we get rid of X and Y and still have it merged with the same you know in the same way so we can get the same type of information.


[3/13/2025 6:25 PM] Chance
But like, what is...


[3/13/2025 6:25 PM] Chance
It's all we're doing here is weird.


[3/13/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
Well, because one is one it is.


[3/13/2025 6:26 PM] Autumn
and I am seeing this ideally what we were doing.


[3/13/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
because one is


[3/13/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
census or mortgage data.


[3/13/2025 6:26 PM] Autumn
Right there under yeah where it says merge the two data sets that's where it talks about this is where it gets.


[3/13/2025 6:26 PM] Autumn
He won data set uses latitude and longitude in the others set up his data trials.


[3/13/2025 6:26 PM] Autumn
And we need to convert the latitude and longitude, but that I'm


[3/13/2025 6:26 PM] Autumn
I'm wondering is that necessary?


[3/13/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
that I'm like, what I'm confused on is like.


[3/13/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
What


[3/13/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
Hold on.


[3/13/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
Wait, I'm the grass. Where is that at?


[3/13/2025 6:26 PM] Chance
or is that defined out?
 That should not be...


[3/13/2025 6:27 PM] Chance
Okay, hold on.


[3/13/2025 6:27 PM] Chance
Ah, fine.


[3/13/2025 6:27 PM] Autumn
Uh.


[3/13/2025 6:27 PM] Chance
because like.


[3/13/2025 6:27 PM] Autumn
Mm-hmm.


[3/13/2025 6:27 PM] Chance
So this is joining the, well, so that's all this is doing is converting into...


[3/13/2025 6:27 PM] Autumn
about strategy.


[3/13/2025 6:27 PM] Chance
What this is doing.


[3/13/2025 6:27 PM] Autumn
or oh yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:28 PM] Chance
So.


[3/13/2025 6:28 PM] Autumn
Well, and I see there's the EPSG information like you were talking about Ashland.


[3/13/2025 6:28 PM] Chance
or just explain more is that uh...


[3/13/2025 6:28 PM] Ashlyn
What do you say, autumn?


[3/13/2025 6:28 PM] Autumn
Oh, I was just watching the code block and it said something about that.


[3/13/2025 6:28 PM] Autumn
EPSG


[3/13/2025 6:28 PM] Autumn
data and that's what you were talking about correct like you had to find that.


[3/13/2025 6:28 PM] Ashlyn
how to make them both.


[3/13/2025 6:28 PM] Ashlyn
match.


[3/13/2025 6:28 PM] Chance
Let me try for the RAM. See.


[3/13/2025 6:28 PM] Chance
That is a thing.
 Thank you very much.


[3/13/2025 6:28 PM] Kirstin
Okay, so the question, so Ashlyn, you're working on the data bias.


[3/13/2025 6:28 PM] Kirstin
And...


[3/13/2025 6:28 PM] Kirstin
Are you working on the Ramsey?


[3/13/2025 6:28 PM] Kirstin
extension.


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Chance
Yes.


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Kirstin
Okay.


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Autumn
Are you sure?
 Well, like, we should not leave you alone with this.


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Chance
I mean, once I get it done, it's good, it's fine, but it's just getting it to that manageable point.


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Autumn
Right.


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Chance
So I'm trying to think what would be the...


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Kirstin
The way that he has it listed in the assignment is that the initial analysis is half of the work.


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Kirstin
And then the bias investigation, data and algorithms combined is 30% and then the RAMSE is 20%.


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Kirstin
I don't know.


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Chance
So I guess I can jump in with me.


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Kirstin
I always want to split it up.


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Ashlyn
and the...


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Autumn
And you're still sharing.


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Autumn
William Hart Eale.


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Kirstin
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:29 PM] Ashlyn
Thanks for watching.


[3/13/2025 6:30 PM] Ashlyn
and then either we all do the rams here,
 just one of us, but as long as these
 that I have in this word document.


[3/13/2025 6:30 PM] Ashlyn
the Ramsey's like another step that needs to be done.


[3/13/2025 6:30 PM] Ashlyn
Additionally, to these that are on the list.


[3/13/2025 6:30 PM] Kirstin
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:30 PM] Kirstin
So I can do the algorithmic bias if everybody is okay.


[3/13/2025 6:30 PM] Kirstin
with that.


[3/13/2025 6:30 PM] Chance
So I can do...


[3/13/2025 6:30 PM] Chance
I can jump in on part one.


[3/13/2025 6:30 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, it looks like we're going to maybe have to collaborate on part one or something.


[3/13/2025 6:30 PM] Chance
like because I can do


[3/13/2025 6:30 PM] Chance
Yeah, I like.


[3/13/2025 6:30 PM] Autumn
And I was doing some research on that last night.
 I mean...


[3/13/2025 6:30 PM] Autumn
It's the historical pieces around.


[3/13/2025 6:30 PM] Chance
Well, because a lot of the historical piece, like we can literally just cite the


[3/13/2025 6:30 PM] Chance
Like the...


[3/13/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
U.M.N. or U.M.N's, like.


[3/13/2025 6:31 PM] Autumn
We're done.


[3/13/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
because that's like, we can use that as...


[3/13/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
like kind of summarize what?


[3/13/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
Their mission was what they found.


[3/13/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
and whatnot.


[3/13/2025 6:31 PM] Autumn
Yeah, and I found some historical data on kind of


[3/13/2025 6:31 PM] Autumn
Oh, you know, migration of African Americans from the south into the north and midwest like led to the great migration and


[3/13/2025 6:31 PM] Autumn
essentially competition for economic and housing resources, which then led to the covenants, but um


[3/13/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
So.


[3/13/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
Did date that's an easy one?


[3/13/2025 6:31 PM] Autumn
Thank you.


[3/13/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
racial race like what is


[3/13/2025 6:31 PM] Chance
that's...


[3/13/2025 6:32 PM] Chance
what I'm gonna try to do is


[3/13/2025 6:32 PM] Autumn
So, and I pulled this up so I guess that leaves for visualizations and report writing.


[3/13/2025 6:32 PM] Autumn
Great maps and visualizations, okay.


[3/13/2025 6:32 PM] Autumn
I've never used a G-opanda?
 Um.


[3/13/2025 6:32 PM] Kirstin
Maybe you there.


[3/13/2025 6:32 PM] Autumn
creation of backups. So I'm like fine.


[3/13/2025 6:32 PM] Autumn
And he said I asked him after class, I mean, if GOP and his install this may be something
 I can put in chat GBT and ask for some assistance, he said as long as


[3/13/2025 6:32 PM] Autumn
we um.


[3/13/2025 6:32 PM] Autumn
you know, note that that's used. He's fine with that.


[3/13/2025 6:32 PM] Autumn
So...


[3/13/2025 6:32 PM] Chance
Uh.


[3/13/2025 6:32 PM] Autumn
It's a world, but in full transparency, I may reach out.


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Autumn
To you all, if I get completely stuck.


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Autumn
Is that okay?


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Kirstin
That's a team effort.


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Kirstin
I said, I said.


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Autumn
And you know, once we get things in order because I did some basic analysis, you know, with the data set that he provided and just some, like,


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Autumn
like a couple bar graphs in grouping by like income and race.


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Chance
Yeah, I was able to do.


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, it mentions.


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Chance
I got like a pretty decent, um,


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Chance
Cana.


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Chance
the.


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Chance
support lecturing.


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, it mentions like analyzing the end of them county for like property value patterns lending disparities demographic correlation.


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Autumn
Yeah, I did, um, I did a little bit. I mean, I didn't go crazy, but...


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Chance
I need to...


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Autumn
my my notebook is uploaded to get um like a couple bar graphs it was about like


[3/13/2025 6:33 PM] Chance
I guess this would technically fall under Part 3 as well.


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
like modeling bias.


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Autumn
I'm sorry which one I had switched screens for a second.


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
Um.


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Autumn
It's okay, never mind, I'm sorry, I don't mean it like, throw you off.


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
So...


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
Oh, no, no, no, you're good, you're good.
 Um.


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
This racial reds column.


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
What does that look like in the data set?


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Autumn
All right, now is...


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
Thank you.


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
Oh.


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Autumn
So that, I don't know what they named it that, it's like basically the context of the covenant itself.


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
I don't know what I'm looking for, John.


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Autumn
And so that is


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
um...


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Autumn
And again, I was trying to compare the two hin of hencownie data sets.


[3/13/2025 6:34 PM] Chance
for no lots.


[3/13/2025 6:35 PM] Chance
So that should be...


[3/13/2025 6:35 PM] Autumn
Covenant text in the Ramsey Davis.


[3/13/2025 6:35 PM] Chance
So, and then I'll just get rid of...


[3/13/2025 6:35 PM] Chance
Those.


[3/13/2025 6:35 PM] Autumn
Yeah, what was that lucky? It looks like so document I


[3/13/2025 6:35 PM] Autumn
And I think document number may be the same thing I noticed in the data dictionary that
 that.


[3/13/2025 6:35 PM] Autumn
researchers doing like the Hinnepin County had added in.


[3/13/2025 6:35 PM] Autumn
a letter in front of the codes.


[3/13/2025 6:35 PM] Autumn
Um...


[3/13/2025 6:35 PM] Autumn
And I can't remember what there's like an A, M, and a T.
 I can't remember what those stand for.
 So I'm not a hundred percent.


[3/13/2025 6:35 PM] Autumn
on those columns aligned.


[3/13/2025 6:35 PM] Autumn
but I think that's what happens. I have that raise


[3/13/2025 6:35 PM] Kirstin
What happened?


[3/13/2025 6:35 PM] Autumn
reds, and covenant text align, and then cellar is grantor, and fire is grantee.


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Autumn
Is this helpful or am I just battling on?


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
so I'm trying to figure out...


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Kirstin
Okay, I was going to say I could take a couple of the bullet points in the


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Kirstin
first section, but they are actually already in my section, so never mind.


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Kirstin
I was going to say, oh, I think the proxy variables and like the lending patterns, like goes with the algorithmic bias, but it's already.


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Kirstin
to have GPT or whoever already put that in there, so never mind.


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
That's so.


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
Like, even if I try to like skip this, it's like, I can't perform the final join.


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Autumn
Hmm.


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
It...


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Kirstin
I'm gonna see you next time.


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Autumn
Thank you.


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
Because like, what I did was I was like, oh, what I'm going to do is I'm going to...


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
like match these up the best I can.


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Chance
for eliminate slim.


[3/13/2025 6:36 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Chance
But then it's like, down here, it's like we're creating.


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Kirstin
can't see your live stream. Let me go back in.


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Kirstin
It crashed.


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Autumn
We'll be able to post something I'm wondering if it was realized that all the data sets weren't formed.


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Autumn
I move it in the same way.


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Chance
We'll...


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Autumn
maybe it was. We maybe that's part of it that we just have to


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Kirstin
Yes!


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Autumn
You mean, yeah, I didn't just figure it out that this code is near.


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Autumn
And we can.


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Autumn
you know.


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Kirstin
I figured it out you guys.
 is.


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Autumn
get not format at the same exact way but we can take the important pieces because you mean


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Autumn
even really like things like


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Autumn
grant or grantee.


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Autumn
I don't think.


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Chance
of the plague.


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Autumn
are necessary for you know, working at like the the track and


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Autumn
the text and even the text. I don't really just kidding me.


[3/13/2025 6:37 PM] Chance
That yeah, that's like


[3/13/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
So.


[3/13/2025 6:38 PM] Autumn
The distance is tracked and the mortgage stuff merged and then we can because all of the mortgage data has like race and ethnicity and that's the the me of everything.


[3/13/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
Mmm.


[3/13/2025 6:38 PM] Autumn
And if I'm wrong, please anyone feel free to correct me, but that's how I'm reading all of this as I sat within a little bit more


[3/13/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
I was like, why is it?


[3/13/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
and those sorts of tracks.


[3/13/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
Let me come back over to here.


[3/13/2025 6:38 PM] Chance
What does covenants with tracks look like?


[3/13/2025 6:39 PM] Kirstin
Thank you very much.


[3/13/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
This is what it looks like.


[3/13/2025 6:39 PM] Autumn
And which one are you looking at?


[3/13/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
the covenants with


[3/13/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
Tracks.


[3/13/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
which is this one. It's a join of


[3/13/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
or hold on any to restart this because they change treeable names.


[3/13/2025 6:39 PM] Kirstin
Thank you.


[3/13/2025 6:39 PM] Chance
The glasses.


[3/13/2025 6:39 PM] Autumn
because.


[3/13/2025 6:39 PM] Autumn
So I'm looking at the state of Minnesota just a whole data set.


[3/13/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
and then


[3/13/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
mortgage. Okay, mortgage covenant. That's what he created.


[3/13/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
I'm wondering if we could take this?
 Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
because the...


[3/13/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
The Minnesota has a census tract call on.


[3/13/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
So not merge, but filter.


[3/13/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
Mortgage data.


[3/13/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
filter for rams brownie, yeah, and then


[3/13/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
Mm-hm.


[3/13/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
filter or not.


[3/13/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
Merge based off of census tract or join, or now not join on census tract.


[3/13/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
But maybe, maybe that's...


[3/13/2025 6:40 PM] Autumn
something.


[3/13/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
because like the census tract would not necessarily


[3/13/2025 6:40 PM] Chance
I kind of think.


[3/13/2025 6:41 PM] Autumn
And there's shout to the Nord and I don't know.


[3/13/2025 6:41 PM] Autumn
Maybe he'll respond.


[3/13/2025 6:41 PM] Autumn
That would be the best thing.


[3/13/2025 6:41 PM] Kirstin
Now if you can, like, sometime before it's due, please.


[3/13/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:41 PM] Autumn
Again, should we talk about potentially?


[3/13/2025 6:41 PM] Autumn
a plan B for getting?


[3/13/2025 6:41 PM] Autumn
Ramsey County data in a different way and how to look at it?


[3/13/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
So that's why I'm like trying to like mentally go through right now because I'm like if we


[3/13/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
Try to think like what we can throw out from this code.


[3/13/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
We're holding on.
 Um...


[3/13/2025 6:41 PM] Chance
because I'm like, if we, uh,


[3/13/2025 6:42 PM] Chance
This gives us these census tracts.


[3/13/2025 6:42 PM] Chance
um...


[3/13/2025 6:42 PM] Chance
Thanks.


[3/13/2025 6:42 PM] Chance
Mm.


[3/13/2025 6:42 PM] Kirstin
more going to prove all right.


[3/13/2025 6:42 PM] Chance
like.


[3/13/2025 6:42 PM] Chance
I want to see if this is the same.


[3/13/2025 6:42 PM] Chance
for a little while, I guess I need to do that after...


[3/13/2025 6:42 PM] Autumn
So, Ashlyn, I've...


[3/13/2025 6:43 PM] Autumn
the link pulled up, I'll just put my name as number four if that's okay with you.
 Thanks for creating this.


[3/13/2025 6:43 PM] Kirstin
It does make it a little bit easier like I feel like the assignment is all over the place.


[3/13/2025 6:43 PM] Autumn
I want to read it so many times.


[3/13/2025 6:43 PM] Kirstin
Like, what are you wanting us to do?


[3/13/2025 6:43 PM] Ashlyn
What's going on with ADHD or something?


[3/13/2025 6:43 PM] Kirstin
I don't know. He's like not on the really good instructions at all.


[3/13/2025 6:43 PM] Chance
which like i think is fine but like


[3/13/2025 6:43 PM] Chance
But it's like the plan, the date, the Ramsey's County extension early, it's like.


[3/13/2025 6:43 PM] Chance
Data collection takes time, it's like, yes, the data collection takes time because like, it's not.


[3/13/2025 6:43 PM] Chance
And I understand that like it's a lot part of it is like thinking on our feet and like it's not always gonna be like an easy


[3/13/2025 6:43 PM] Chance
And like maybe that's part of the challenge with this one is it like


[3/13/2025 6:43 PM] Autumn
Right.


[3/13/2025 6:43 PM] Chance
We're supposed to kind of like, think outside the box,
 I'm like, how to...


[3/13/2025 6:43 PM] Chance
Get that information.


[3/13/2025 6:44 PM] Kirstin
Well, I'm not ready for outside the box.


[3/13/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
But I'm like, I'm like,


[3/13/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
trying to figure out


[3/13/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
What element of this, I guess?


[3/13/2025 6:44 PM] Autumn
That mean you're in a different level of approval interest rates.


[3/13/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
Um, hold on.


[3/13/2025 6:44 PM] Autumn
And I'm also looking at pamphlet, pamphlet.


[3/13/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
Short cut to


[3/13/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
Yes, kid.


[3/13/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
tree.


[3/13/2025 6:44 PM] Chance
I'm just going to comment out things until it


[3/13/2025 6:45 PM] Kirstin
I do that. Get rid of everything until I know what I need it.


[3/13/2025 6:45 PM] Chance
Bye.


[3/13/2025 6:45 PM] Chance
Let's just purr-tract.


[3/13/2025 6:45 PM] Autumn
Hmm.


[3/13/2025 6:45 PM] Chance
But click or jump.


[3/13/2025 6:45 PM] Chance
I don't...


[3/13/2025 6:45 PM] Autumn
I forgot, I'm really going through that.


[3/13/2025 6:45 PM] Autumn
I'm home.


[3/13/2025 6:45 PM] Autumn
And I'm sorry if I missed this. Do we have a Google doc already to start like putting?


[3/13/2025 6:45 PM] Autumn
pieces on there.


[3/13/2025 6:45 PM] Chance
I haven't made one.


[3/13/2025 6:46 PM] Chance
I don't know if anybody else has?


[3/13/2025 6:46 PM] Kirstin
Not yet.


[3/13/2025 6:46 PM] Autumn
We're not.


[3/13/2025 6:46 PM] Autumn
I made sure the slides were cleaned up.


[3/13/2025 6:46 PM] Autumn
But do we do we want to do that again?
 So or Ashlyn were you thinking
 because you created this one drive document?
 We put our pieces under our section on here.


[3/13/2025 6:46 PM] Chance
I think if we just use Google Doc again, just because otherwise for us to meet the


[3/13/2025 6:46 PM] Chance
the expectations of the assignment like we have to use


[3/13/2025 6:46 PM] Chance
the tracking feature of


[3/13/2025 6:46 PM] Autumn
Thank you.


[3/13/2025 6:46 PM] Kirstin
And so annoying and bored like


[3/13/2025 6:46 PM] Kirstin
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:46 PM] Chance
So I think Google Doc is just a cleaner.
 It's more legible, more...


[3/13/2025 6:46 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, the track changes in word is really irritating.


[3/13/2025 6:46 PM] Chance
really ugly, you can say that ugly.


[3/13/2025 6:47 PM] Kirstin
it's so crazy. Yeah, it does.


[3/13/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
I'm not a teacher.


[3/13/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
Ooooooo!


[3/13/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
Look, I don't need the...


[3/13/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
But if I just comment out all of this, and then run the whole thing, now they need the...


[3/13/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
I need that covenant stuff.


[3/13/2025 6:47 PM] Autumn
What's in them?


[3/13/2025 6:47 PM] Autumn
Hmm.


[3/13/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
Because this is like converting.


[3/13/2025 6:47 PM] Autumn
I'm gonna... Yeah!


[3/13/2025 6:47 PM] Autumn
And so there's nothing about covenants in the mortgage data.


[3/13/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
no because it's like a dick


[3/13/2025 6:47 PM] Chance
It's like the mortgage data is


[3/13/2025 6:48 PM] Chance
just like the ledger of


[3/13/2025 6:48 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:48 PM] Autumn
I never know.


[3/13/2025 6:48 PM] Chance
could like, what are final, the final data set is basically just?


[3/13/2025 6:48 PM] Chance
like.


[3/13/2025 6:48 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:48 PM] Autumn
Thank you.


[3/13/2025 6:48 PM] Chance
All right, I'm back.


[3/13/2025 6:48 PM] Chance
Oh no.


[3/13/2025 6:49 PM] Chance
Liberty.


[3/13/2025 6:49 PM] Chance
different if...


[3/13/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
So in the student notebook, he's merged the


[3/13/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
of an at data.


[3/13/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
and the Minnesota data.


[3/13/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
Is it done correctly?


[3/13/2025 6:51 PM] Chance
So.


[3/13/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
because it says applications interact with covenants zero.


[3/13/2025 6:51 PM] Chance
Bye.


[3/13/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
practice cabinets, approval rates as a null value at the end.


[3/13/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
Delay!


[3/13/2025 6:51 PM] Kirstin
What?


[3/13/2025 6:51 PM] Chance
Oh, well, because that's tracks with covenants would be...


[3/13/2025 6:51 PM] Chance
I want to say that that is based off of...


[3/13/2025 6:51 PM] Chance
Yeah, it was approved, which is a Boolean value.


[3/13/2025 6:51 PM] Chance
So that's why it's not a number.


[3/13/2025 6:52 PM] Kirstin
Oh, good. Okay. It looks like a little word. Here we go.


[3/13/2025 6:52 PM] Kirstin
But for the algorithmic bias section, I would be using this combined data.


[3/13/2025 6:52 PM] Chance
which is.


[3/13/2025 6:52 PM] Kirstin
that is a result of this notebook, right?


[3/13/2025 6:52 PM] Chance
Yes, but the combined data is just the mortgage covenant data.


[3/13/2025 6:52 PM] Kirstin
Okay.


[3/13/2025 6:52 PM] Chance
Like it, it's the data set that we've already received.


[3/13/2025 6:52 PM] Kirstin
Oh, what the hell?


[3/13/2025 6:52 PM] Autumn
which is the henna pin and


[3/13/2025 6:52 PM] Kirstin
in the hand of Pemka.


[3/13/2025 6:52 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:52 PM] Autumn
It's for Ram's ebbs.


[3/13/2025 6:52 PM] Chance
It's, yeah, it's, it's.


[3/13/2025 6:52 PM] Autumn
being misbehaving.


[3/13/2025 6:52 PM] Autumn
But I'll say.


[3/13/2025 6:53 PM] Autumn
in a recorded chat.


[3/13/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
like I wonder what this


[3/13/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
Like these, Chio.


[3/13/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
like this Geo Address and Geo


[3/13/2025 6:53 PM] Chance
Gocd distance, I don't know what those mean.


[3/13/2025 6:53 PM] Autumn
That's how that was looking at me, and I didn't know if...


[3/13/2025 6:53 PM] Autumn
G.O.C.D. Distance was the same.


[3/13/2025 6:54 PM] Autumn
as distance itself and if we could somehow use that.


[3/13/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
but it's like all the values in both of those are blank.


[3/13/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
because see that's the other thing that's like that's annoying about this is like


[3/13/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
Like, I would love to...


[3/13/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
just like.


[3/13/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
know what actually let me double check


[3/13/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
um


[3/13/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
Kid, I'm a little bit scared


[3/13/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
Maps, dear. Uh...


[3/13/2025 6:54 PM] Chance
for racial covenants in Minnesota and beyond.


[3/13/2025 6:55 PM] Chance
So how does all of those mean?


[3/13/2025 6:55 PM] Chance
I'm looking at...


[3/13/2025 6:55 PM] Autumn
Okay, where are you at working?
 Yeah.


[3/13/2025 6:55 PM] Chance
This um...


[3/13/2025 6:55 PM] Autumn
Okay, thank you. Yes, I just didn't explore far enough.


[3/13/2025 6:55 PM] Chance
Well, because that's where, like, that's whenever I responded to Abby's discussion board.


[3/13/2025 6:55 PM] Autumn
Mm hmm.


[3/13/2025 6:55 PM] Chance
This is where I was getting my data for Hennepin County.


[3/13/2025 6:55 PM] Autumn
Right.


[3/13/2025 6:55 PM] Chance
I was like, hey, yeah, this is strange.


[3/13/2025 6:56 PM] Autumn
Oh, there it is at the bottom, I didn't scroll down enough.


[3/13/2025 6:56 PM] Autumn
Geocoded Address of Parcel Centroid.


[3/13/2025 6:56 PM] Kirstin
You can.


[3/13/2025 6:56 PM] Chance
Oh, tch, tch.


[3/13/2025 6:56 PM] Chance
I wonder if I need to...


[3/13/2025 6:56 PM] Chance
I don't know what.


[3/13/2025 6:57 PM] Chance
So there's the GeoJSON file.


[3/13/2025 6:57 PM] Chance
Let me try downloading this.


[3/13/2025 6:58 PM] Chance
Let me try something else.
 So I just downloaded the GeoJson file.


[3/13/2025 6:58 PM] Chance
Listen me.


[3/13/2025 6:58 PM] Chance
This will probably just have all of the same information and a cup text.


[3/13/2025 6:58 PM] Kirstin
Now I'm sure it's my computer.


[3/13/2025 6:58 PM] Kirstin
Perfect.


[3/13/2025 6:58 PM] Chance
This is literally just all the same information, though.


[3/13/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
What is...


[3/13/2025 6:59 PM] Chance
Johnny Pan?


[3/13/2025 7:00 PM] Kirstin
Okay, what are you um?


[3/13/2025 7:00 PM] Kirstin
What are you trying to figure out exactly?


[3/13/2025 7:00 PM] Chance
I was trying to see if...


[3/13/2025 7:00 PM] Chance
using a like so the


[3/13/2025 7:00 PM] Chance
Um.


[3/13/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
The GitHub that I pulled the Ramsey County information from.


[3/13/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
mention that like it, there are different file formats available for each
 and I was like, oh, maybe like...


[3/13/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
Maybe we're just using the wrong type of file, like maybe we don't need to be using.


[3/13/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
um, let's see SV, but it's like it's all the same information and


[3/13/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
Like the, um...


[3/13/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
Oh wait, maybe not.


[3/13/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
Hold up, we might be cooking.


[3/13/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
because...


[3/13/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
Geometry is not something that's in the...


[3/13/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
This might be what we need to use.


[3/13/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
Okay, hold on.


[3/13/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
thing we might be on the right track now.


[3/13/2025 7:01 PM] Chance
I hope we're on the right track.


[3/13/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
Thank you.


[3/13/2025 7:02 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, the dataset from the government, whatever website.


[3/13/2025 7:02 PM] Kirstin
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's website.


[3/13/2025 7:02 PM] Kirstin
For Minnesota, it does contain the census tract numbers and the county codes for all of the counties including Ramsey.


[3/13/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
Like what?


[3/13/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
So what I'm going to try to do right now is I'm going to


[3/13/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
Instead of reading and...


[3/13/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
the CSV.


[3/13/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
I'm going to read in this Geo.


[3/13/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
Jason Fiehl.


[3/13/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
How do I do that?


[3/13/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
for me.


[3/13/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
and Gio.
 Cheers, Anna.


[3/13/2025 7:02 PM] Chance
Are you so, Anna?


[3/13/2025 7:03 PM] Chance
That's part of G.O. Pandas.


[3/13/2025 7:03 PM] Chance
I think.


[3/13/2025 7:03 PM] Chance
those she opandals, that was GPD.


[3/13/2025 7:03 PM] Chance
So let's do covenant.


[3/13/2025 7:03 PM] Chance
GPD, duh.


[3/13/2025 7:03 PM] Chance
Read, I'll.


[3/13/2025 7:03 PM] Chance
Not that slush.


[3/13/2025 7:03 PM] Chance
to be a slash.


[3/13/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
Okay.


[3/13/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
Because yeah, this is...


[3/13/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
something that was not there before.


[3/13/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
I think that the original like the CSV data set.


[3/13/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
ends here.


[3/13/2025 7:04 PM] Kirstin
Peace.


[3/13/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
because what geometry is doing is.


[3/13/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
basically creating a


[3/13/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
like a block.


[3/13/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
within which.


[3/13/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
It exists for them, I think.


[3/13/2025 7:04 PM] Chance
Okay, so there's that, now I need to modify...


[3/13/2025 7:05 PM] Chance
This...


[3/13/2025 7:05 PM] Chance
because this is already in latitude and...


[3/13/2025 7:05 PM] Chance
for all.


[3/13/2025 7:05 PM] Autumn
Hey! Okay, here's something else if I may.


[3/13/2025 7:05 PM] Autumn
Bye!


[3/13/2025 7:05 PM] Autumn
Put the other one up.


[3/13/2025 7:05 PM] Autumn
Okay, the mortgage covenant data and the Ramsey data is what were.


[3/13/2025 7:05 PM] Autumn
essentially trying to get correct.


[3/13/2025 7:05 PM] Chance
Ehhhhhh!


[3/13/2025 7:05 PM] Chance
For RIMs, yes.


[3/13/2025 7:05 PM] Autumn
Yeah, okay, because they both have census tract.


[3/13/2025 7:05 PM] Autumn
I'm just putting out there, let me drop the CSV because I just put both of those in chat
 GPT and ask if they could merge the data.
 So maybe we can just use the CSV and not deal with a bunch of code and we have it all
 in one place.


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Kirstin
Just a little bit.


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Autumn
Or does that sound horrible?
 I just got real quiet.
 Maybe scared.


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Kirstin
No, you're good.


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Autumn
Oh my God.


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Kirstin
Oh my God, I don't know.


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Chance
I'm


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Kirstin
I guess we'll receive.


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Chance
Looking into the web.


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Autumn
Because it is, you know, as long as we disclose or I will disclose that that's what I did.


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Autumn
Thank you.


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Chance
So.


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Chance
shall it shoot you?


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Autumn
Thank you.


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Kirstin
There's like just too much data listed in this.


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Kirstin
I'll check.


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Autumn
And they said there's a lot.


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Kirstin
I'm like, what?


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Chance
So, like, don't need...


[3/13/2025 7:06 PM] Kirstin
What is it you want me to do?


[3/13/2025 7:07 PM] Chance
I think?


[3/13/2025 7:07 PM] Chance
because we don't have to convert it.


[3/13/2025 7:07 PM] Chance
because this is already latitude and longitude, I think.


[3/13/2025 7:07 PM] Autumn
says my files too big and I'm not a nitro member.


[3/13/2025 7:07 PM] Kirstin
Of course.


[3/13/2025 7:07 PM] Chance
So.


[3/13/2025 7:07 PM] Chance
All of these are...


[3/13/2025 7:07 PM] Autumn
Okay. This is me.


[3/13/2025 7:07 PM] Chance
Multi-polygon.


[3/13/2025 7:08 PM] Autumn
And I can email her.


[3/13/2025 7:08 PM] Kirstin
That would work.


[3/13/2025 7:08 PM] Autumn
Yeah, I shouldn't...


[3/13/2025 7:08 PM] Autumn
if you all want to look at it because it it did merge the Ramsey stuff with the Morgan


[3/13/2025 7:08 PM] Autumn
covenant data that was already created.


[3/13/2025 7:08 PM] Autumn
with this code.


[3/13/2025 7:08 PM] Autumn
Okay, Ashlyn.


[3/13/2025 7:08 PM] Ashlyn
Shhh!


[3/13/2025 7:08 PM] Autumn
Are you there?


[3/13/2025 7:08 PM] Autumn
Okay, I'm sorry, because I'm doing share and I'm just typing in names for our MTSU email addresses.


[3/13/2025 7:09 PM] Autumn
Which email do I use? Ashlam Strickland or Brown?


[3/13/2025 7:09 PM] Autumn
or either.


[3/13/2025 7:09 PM] Ashlyn
like the Emo with the letters.


[3/13/2025 7:09 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 7:09 PM] Ashlyn
if it's ASB6E.


[3/13/2025 7:09 PM] Autumn
Oh, I'm sorry. Is it ASB6P?


[3/13/2025 7:09 PM] Autumn
at M.T. mail. Okay, cool.


[3/13/2025 7:09 PM] Ashlyn
Thank you.


[3/13/2025 7:10 PM] Autumn
Okay, I just shared a link with you all.


[3/13/2025 7:10 PM] Autumn
the MTSU email and I can put it somewhere else like I said it just wouldn't let me drop it in this
 chat it said the file was too big


[3/13/2025 7:11 PM] Chance
We really not need to.


[3/13/2025 7:11 PM] Chance
me coming up.


[3/13/2025 7:15 PM] Chance
is this not the same?


[3/13/2025 7:15 PM] Chance
eyes.


[3/13/2025 7:15 PM] Kirstin
Pure cool.


[3/13/2025 7:15 PM] Chance
So after consulting with the Oracle, I think I...


[3/13/2025 7:15 PM] Chance
I think I...


[3/13/2025 7:15 PM] Chance
fixed it.


[3/13/2025 7:15 PM] Chance
So.


[3/13/2025 7:15 PM] Chance
Um.


[3/13/2025 7:15 PM] Chance
Run all.


[3/13/2025 7:15 PM] Chance
Why did it turn?


[3/13/2025 7:15 PM] Chance
So it's a different size, so I guess that's a good sign.


[3/13/2025 7:15 PM] Chance
I think I made...


[3/13/2025 7:15 PM] Chance
Do it, do it, I think it did it.


[3/13/2025 7:16 PM] Chance
Holy shit, I think, I think I did it.


[3/13/2025 7:16 PM] Kirstin
Yay!


[3/13/2025 7:16 PM] Chance
Thank you.


[3/13/2025 7:16 PM] Autumn
Way above.


[3/13/2025 7:16 PM] Chance
So.


[3/13/2025 7:16 PM] Chance
the.


[3/13/2025 7:16 PM] Chance
Hold on, before I forget.


[3/13/2025 7:16 PM] Chance
going to you all.


[3/13/2025 7:16 PM] Chance
I'm so proud of you.


[3/13/2025 7:16 PM] Chance
inside with the...


[3/13/2025 7:16 PM] Chance
Shatchy PT.


[3/13/2025 7:16 PM] Chance
And then also, I guess, I can...


[3/13/2025 7:16 PM] Chance
Duh!


[3/13/2025 7:16 PM] Chance
tch, tch, tch, tch.


[3/13/2025 7:16 PM] Chance
So when it's slim actually needed.


[3/13/2025 7:17 PM] Chance
No.


[3/13/2025 7:17 PM] Chance
No, it is not needed.


[3/13/2025 7:17 PM] Chance
Okay, so.


[3/13/2025 7:17 PM] Chance
We read in the...


[3/13/2025 7:17 PM] Chance
or the GeoJSON file.


[3/13/2025 7:17 PM] Chance
read and...


[3/13/2025 7:17 PM] Chance
Cheers and file.


[3/13/2025 7:17 PM] Chance
Um.


[3/13/2025 7:17 PM] Chance
make sure that it is


[3/13/2025 7:17 PM] Chance
I can delete this as well.


[3/13/2025 7:17 PM] Chance
Allah.


[3/13/2025 7:17 PM] Chance
So check and make sure that it is the correct file type.


[3/13/2025 7:17 PM] Chance
the correct format type.


[3/13/2025 7:17 PM] Chance
Bum, bum, bum, okay, we're going to go side by side here.


[3/13/2025 7:18 PM] Chance
So then,


[3/13/2025 7:18 PM] Chance
print the original records.


[3/13/2025 7:18 PM] Chance
in this case there are only four hundred or five.


[3/13/2025 7:18 PM] Chance
500.


[3/13/2025 7:18 PM] Chance
I'm just going to say 5,500 records.
 That is from the


[3/13/2025 7:18 PM] Chance
Um.


[3/13/2025 7:18 PM] Autumn
Ramsey, which is what you said it had


[3/13/2025 7:18 PM] Autumn
Anyway, right?


[3/13/2025 7:18 PM] Chance
the Ramsey data set.


[3/13/2025 7:18 PM] Autumn
mm hmm


[3/13/2025 7:18 PM] Chance
So then we convert it to...


[3/13/2025 7:18 PM] Chance
this other


[3/13/2025 7:18 PM] Chance
file in the Southern type.


[3/13/2025 7:18 PM] Chance
to match the census tracks.


[3/13/2025 7:18 PM] Chance
And then we have to create centroid.


[3/13/2025 7:19 PM] Chance
That hole on my head said just like.


[3/13/2025 7:19 PM] Chance
did something, I don't know.
 So then we have to


[3/13/2025 7:19 PM] Chance
because all of the...
 Um.


[3/13/2025 7:19 PM] Chance
All of the...


[3/13/2025 7:19 PM] Chance
Geometry use? So.


[3/13/2025 7:19 PM] Chance
What this code is doing?


[3/13/2025 7:19 PM] Chance
is is taking the x and the y coordinate.


[3/13/2025 7:19 PM] Chance
and basically


[3/13/2025 7:19 PM] Chance
creating a range and then lake.


[3/13/2025 7:19 PM] Chance
I'm interpreting it, it's...


[3/13/2025 7:19 PM] Chance
reading.


[3/13/2025 7:19 PM] Chance
the ranges, and then it is.


[3/13/2025 7:19 PM] Chance
basically assigning the census tract based off of


[3/13/2025 7:19 PM] Chance
the points position.


[3/13/2025 7:20 PM] Chance
because it's given an x and a y, so it's one dot.


[3/13/2025 7:20 PM] Chance
on a plane.


[3/13/2025 7:20 PM] Chance
this GeoJson how it's structured is it is a


[3/13/2025 7:20 PM] Chance
collection of points to create a collection of shapes.


[3/13/2025 7:20 PM] Chance
You all can hear me, right?


[3/13/2025 7:20 PM] Kirstin
Yes.


[3/13/2025 7:20 PM] Chance
Okay. Um, so it's like it's.


[3/13/2025 7:20 PM] Chance
It's a collection of points that create a, uh, that create.


[3/13/2025 7:20 PM] Chance
shapes that are within a collection.


[3/13/2025 7:20 PM] Chance
So like, looking at this data, we have...


[3/13/2025 7:20 PM] Chance
like this is one point, here's another point.


[3/13/2025 7:20 PM] Chance
And if we go over to


[3/13/2025 7:20 PM] Chance
like, there's eventually, like, probably,


[3/13/2025 7:20 PM] Chance
I get creates.


[3/13/2025 7:21 PM] Chance
a sheep that's the only way I can.


[3/13/2025 7:21 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, I like creates the track or whatever.


[3/13/2025 7:21 PM] Ashlyn
Ashlyn disconnected


[3/13/2025 7:21 PM] Chance
I like it create. Yeah, it creates like the box around like what would be classifier and like
 Oh.


[3/13/2025 7:21 PM] Chance
Oh, that's fine.


[3/13/2025 7:21 PM] Kirstin
Thanks for happening.


[3/13/2025 7:21 PM] Chance
So.


[3/13/2025 7:21 PM] Chance
actually had to drop out, but we're good.
 Um.


[3/13/2025 7:21 PM] Chance
What we're doing here is we are getting the centroid, so finding the center.


[3/13/2025 7:21 PM] Chance
point, I guess.


[3/13/2025 7:21 PM] Chance
um...


[3/13/2025 7:21 PM] Chance
tadaaaaah!


[3/13/2025 7:21 PM] Chance
Um, so it is.


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
Converting, it's finding the middle point or like the middle most point for each of these entries in


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
the, uh,


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
like each row like it's finding the middlemost point


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
and assigning it to the relevant.


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
This is like how I think it's working.


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
And then it's creating the spatial join.


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
of the...


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
the, um,


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
the geopandist data with the


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
ramsy tracks


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
that were created.


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
up here, which is like where we filtered out the


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
Um.


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
like the census tracts for like one, two, three.


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
So then...


[3/13/2025 7:22 PM] Chance
It's doing the summary, what is this?


[3/13/2025 7:23 PM] Chance
running mismatch. Okay, I need to figure that out. I don't know what's going on with that.
 What is that supposed to look like? Oh, no, that is normal. Okay, that is...


[3/13/2025 7:23 PM] Chance
So then we're able to...


[3/13/2025 7:23 PM] Chance
Run.


[3/13/2025 7:23 PM] Chance
This?


[3/13/2025 7:23 PM] Chance
since it's tracks after...


[3/13/2025 7:23 PM] Chance
his mortgage slim come in.


[3/13/2025 7:23 PM] Chance
So it's this right here.


[3/13/2025 7:23 PM] Chance
Okay, so then this is...


[3/13/2025 7:23 PM] Chance
This is going to look the same because it's just


[3/13/2025 7:23 PM] Chance
taking the, it's just cleaning through the,


[3/13/2025 7:23 PM] Chance
the mortgage slim thing.


[3/13/2025 7:23 PM] Chance
And then we create this new thing.


[3/13/2025 7:23 PM] Chance
Thank you very much.


[3/13/2025 7:23 PM] Chance
There are more applications in...


[3/13/2025 7:24 PM] Chance
and mortgage, mortgage applications in Ramsey County than there were in


[3/13/2025 7:24 PM] Kirstin
And that pen.


[3/13/2025 7:24 PM] Chance
Hannah Pan.


[3/13/2025 7:24 PM] Chance
There we are.


[3/13/2025 7:24 PM] Chance
Tracks with new covenants.


[3/13/2025 7:24 PM] Chance
that had a pattern.


[3/13/2025 7:24 PM] Chance
and then it works.


[3/13/2025 7:24 PM] Kirstin
Yay!


[3/13/2025 7:24 PM] Chance
I got nothing.


[3/13/2025 7:24 PM] Autumn
That means, thank you.


[3/13/2025 7:24 PM] Kirstin
Explanation.


[3/13/2025 7:24 PM] Chance
like


[3/13/2025 7:24 PM] Chance
like what is this?


[3/13/2025 7:24 PM] Chance
I want to see, so there's two ways that we can,
 that the data can be merged.


[3/13/2025 7:25 PM] Chance
And I put it.


[3/13/2025 7:25 PM] Chance
Ooooooh!


[3/13/2025 7:25 PM] Chance
damn.


[3/13/2025 7:25 PM] Chance
Thanks for watching!


[3/13/2025 7:25 PM] Chance
um so we can either do
 you.


[3/13/2025 7:25 PM] Chance
Oh, my God.


[3/13/2025 7:25 PM] Chance
So I want to see what happens if I do covenants with tracks.


[3/13/2025 7:25 PM] Chance
I'll let predicate


[3/13/2025 7:25 PM] Chance
intersex.


[3/13/2025 7:25 PM] Chance
Oh, no.


[3/13/2025 7:25 PM] Chance
Okay, it did not like that.


[3/13/2025 7:26 PM] Chance
I can't believe we're not going to do that.


[3/13/2025 7:26 PM] Chance
So the way that I'm the way that


[3/13/2025 7:26 PM] Chance
rationalizing this. It is.


[3/13/2025 7:26 PM] Chance
that for each row, it's finding the centermost point in the box that it creates.


[3/13/2025 7:26 PM] Chance
like from this nonsense.


[3/13/2025 7:26 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 7:26 PM] Chance
And then it is


[3/13/2025 7:26 PM] Chance
So for each one, it basically creates a point.


[3/13/2025 7:26 PM] Chance
And then it joins


[3/13/2025 7:26 PM] Chance
the...


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Chance
all of those points so each with each row being a point having its own point


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Chance
seeing where that falls within the


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Chance
census track data.


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Chance
Like this stuff.


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Chance
from...


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Chance
Here.


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Chance
That's how I, that's...


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Chance
how it has the...


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Chance
That's the only way that it makes sense to me


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Chance
with your answer.


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Kirstin
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Autumn
because I see that there's like a track to come from the trees and so you


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Chance
Yeah, it looks like.


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Autumn
Yeah, that's what I'm trying.


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Kirstin
Yeah, it basically takes all the latitude and stuff and like Geo fences it into a track like makes them.


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Chance
endless.


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Autumn
how it makes its kind of...


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Chance
destroyed.


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Autumn
I'm making sure that it's really within that track versus potentially being on the edge.


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Chance
I'm sure it.


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Kirstin
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Chance
from.


[3/13/2025 7:27 PM] Autumn
and following the word neighborhood.


[3/13/2025 7:28 PM] Autumn
All right, yes. I'm going to read.


[3/13/2025 7:28 PM] Chance
This, these are multipoli, that's right.


[3/13/2025 7:28 PM] Chance
Multi-polligon.


[3/13/2025 7:28 PM] Chance
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to save this as


[3/13/2025 7:28 PM] Chance
Ramsey.


[3/13/2025 7:29 PM] Chance
pd.dot


[3/13/2025 7:29 PM] Chance
to CSD.


[3/13/2025 7:29 PM] Chance
D-da!


[3/13/2025 7:29 PM] Chance
And then...


[3/13/2025 7:29 PM] Chance
I can't believe that worked.


[3/13/2025 7:30 PM] Autumn
Don't say such things, just save it.


[3/13/2025 7:30 PM] Chance
Hold on, I need.


[3/13/2025 7:30 PM] Autumn
Top War of Nature.


[3/13/2025 7:30 PM] Chance
I want to look at the actual file, though, like NXL because sometimes I just like...


[3/13/2025 7:30 PM] Chance
I don't like working with CSVs, like I want to be able to see.


[3/13/2025 7:30 PM] Autumn
Yeah.


[3/13/2025 7:30 PM] Chance
And so yeah, this looks like it matches the...


[3/13/2025 7:30 PM] Chance
same structure as...


[3/13/2025 7:30 PM] Chance
The other covenant one.


[3/13/2025 7:30 PM] Chance
So then what I guess I can also do?


[3/13/2025 7:30 PM] Chance
or wait, hold on.


[3/13/2025 7:30 PM] Chance
Covenant count.


[3/13/2025 7:30 PM] Chance
was approved. Only thing that's missing in this one is


[3/13/2025 7:30 PM] Chance
I'll teach you why.


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Chance
Let's see if we've got...


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Chance
Activity years since a strike derived for raise action taken load amount property value


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Chance
Income, interest rate.


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Chance
or any population percent.


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Chance
Trapped MSA in Comprisonage, denial of reason.


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Chance
Covenant Count was approved.


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Chance
Only thing that's missing is Covenant density here.


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Chance
which is just one extra column.


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Chance
um yeah.


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Autumn
When I was doing some initial exploration, I don't remember using that.


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Chance
Yeah, it looks like it's just a...


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Chance
So for each of the census tracks.


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Chance
I think.


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Autumn
Yeah, yeah, never mind. It did show a number.


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Kirstin
All right, you know, I have to go make sure my kid to get their homework done.


[3/13/2025 7:31 PM] Autumn
Oh.


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Chance
All right, yours. I think we're in a good spot. And then once I get finished here, I will drop a message just summing up.


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Chance
What's going on?


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Chance
Um.


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Kirstin
Sounds good.


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Kirstin
All right, talk to you later.


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Kirstin
Kirstin disconnected


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Chance
Okay, filter.


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Autumn
Bye!


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Chance
All right.


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Autumn
and chance someone's, do you need anything from ear just working away and I feel like I'm


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Autumn
I love you.


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Autumn
Allusions and I should stop.


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Chance
Okay, so.


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Chance
You're good.
 Um.


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Autumn
You need to just go to work.


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Chance
So what, so what I'm going to do is I will


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Chance
I'm going to make two more changes.
 I'm going to make a


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Chance
Well, so first things first, I'm going to delete the


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Chance
Ramsey County data.


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Chance
I'll see you next time.


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Autumn
Mm hmm.


[3/13/2025 7:32 PM] Chance
We don't need that.


[3/13/2025 7:33 PM] Chance
Oh, it's because it's open over here.
 Um.


[3/13/2025 7:33 PM] Chance
So, hold on, and I'll combine data.


[3/13/2025 7:33 PM] Chance
Covenantch.


[3/13/2025 7:33 PM] Chance
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
 Thank you, Lord.


[3/13/2025 7:33 PM] Chance
create this Covenant density one and then I'm going to create one big file that has all of Ramsey County and all of


[3/13/2025 7:33 PM] Chance
Had a pen.


[3/13/2025 7:33 PM] Autumn
Okay.


[3/13/2025 7:33 PM] Chance
And the nice things will be good.


[3/13/2025 7:33 PM] Chance
At least I'll be able to start throwing models at things.


[3/13/2025 7:33 PM] Chance
Not a problem.


[3/13/2025 7:33 PM] Autumn
Oh my gosh. No, thank you again. I mean so much. That's
 Bye!


[3/13/2025 7:33 PM] Chance
Well, it I mean.


[3/13/2025 7:33 PM] Autumn
I love that you can say that with such ease.
 Um.


[3/13/2025 7:33 PM] Chance
I don't know why I didn't think about this earlier.


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Chance
like the, like, using, if I just assume that, like,


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Autumn
Yeah, right.


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Chance
that all of it would have the same information,
 like, but it's like, this is the,


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Chance
the... the...


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Chance
I don't know, like, this is what...


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Chance
Cracked it open though, the...


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Chance
these coordinates.


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Chance
Like, like these, like this geometry section is what like?


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Autumn
I have to be honest.


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Autumn
I mean, thank you, I hate to even ask so...


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Autumn
Or are you gonna upload that notebook to get hub two or


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Autumn
and utilize that.


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Chance
So all of the changes that I mean.


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Chance
All of the changes that I've made.


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Chance
are are in GitHub.


[3/13/2025 7:34 PM] Autumn
Okay. Okay.


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Chance
So once I finish making these last two columns
 and these data sets,


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Autumn
Mm hmm.


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Chance
like all I have to do is save and then


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Chance
pushed to origin.


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Chance
And then everybody will have access to it.


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Autumn
that I was thinking about.


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Autumn
for the visuals again, I mean...


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Chance
Yeah, we'll end.


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Autumn
You've been very kind and generous, but thank you again. This is awesome.


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Chance
Not a problem.


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Chance
Not a problem.


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Chance
But yeah, so I'm going to knock this out right fast and then


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Chance
I will get...


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Chance
Yeah, because


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Chance
Yeah, like, because once I get, like, once I get this done, I think it should go smoothly.


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Autumn
Oh, well, I'll...


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Chance
Yeah, so.


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Autumn
No, boy.


[3/13/2025 7:35 PM] Chance
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.


[3/13/2025 7:36 PM] Autumn
Oh, no, I was just saying, you know, um,


[3/13/2025 7:36 PM] Autumn
I'm not that much help here, but I am free. I know that other folks have young kiddos, but if there is anything that you need, please let me know and I did just, you know, create.


[3/13/2025 7:36 PM] Autumn
We will talk some slides, you know, doing what I can over here.


[3/13/2025 7:36 PM] Chance
Thank you.
 Pfft.


[3/13/2025 7:36 PM] Autumn
My contribution might it feels so silly, but I dropped a link to the Google Docs
 Thanks.
 Hahaha!


[3/13/2025 7:36 PM] Chance
And I.


[3/13/2025 7:36 PM] Autumn
But yeah, I know I keep saying it, but I do, I don't know from, I'm sure the everyone appreciates you, but from my perspective, I just always want people to know that they're appreciated, especially in a group project like this.


[3/13/2025 7:36 PM] Chance
I am really appreciate, like I feel like we all work super well together like


[3/13/2025 7:36 PM] Autumn
Come on, Mama. Yeah.


[3/13/2025 7:36 PM] Chance
I don't know, this is definitely I think been the most.


[3/13/2025 7:36 PM] Chance
I would say the, I guess I would say like the most shoulder group that I've been in in
 grad school.


[3/13/2025 7:37 PM] Chance
because like, but also I think a lot of it is like we're spending all semester working together on it, like on different projects, so it's not like


[3/13/2025 7:37 PM] Chance
It's not like the data dives where it's like, oh, you're working with people that you've like never met before.


[3/13/2025 7:37 PM] Autumn
Right, whichever had really nice groups, but that's it it's like that is my interaction with


[3/13/2025 7:37 PM] Autumn
And then you start.


[3/13/2025 7:37 PM] Chance
Oh, how did you get feedback
 on your predictive modeling data dive?


[3/13/2025 7:37 PM] Chance
Oh, here.


[3/13/2025 7:37 PM] Autumn
You don't have to, it was...


[3/13/2025 7:37 PM] Autumn
I did. Thank you. Are we still recording?
 Thank you.


[3/13/2025 7:37 PM] Autumn
Um.


[3/13/2025 7:37 PM] Autumn
